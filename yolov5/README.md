# Yolov5 Experiments

1. Please see experiment record from [experiment_record.ipynb](./experiment_record.ipynb).
2. Experiment results are stored in the folder `experiment`.
3. [convert_labels.py](./convert_labels.py) is for converting labels.

For evaluation, you can download our yolo models from this link [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uOf7ET\_-WAHoYVULlqnLyd6LPt9LFU60?usp=drive_link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uOf7ET_-WAHoYVULlqnLyd6LPt9LFU60?usp=drive_link), then modify the `--weights` flag in the notebook to get the results.
