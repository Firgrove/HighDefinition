# HighDefinition

## Methods

For this task we trialed four different methods. Fast R-CNN, DETR, YOLO v5 and various traditional methods. Each of these can be found in their corresponding sub directories. For example the code to train and evaluate the DETR model is found in the DETR/ directory. These directories also contain README files with instructions on how to run each method.
